## PROBLEM STATEMENT

The call center manager needs the analysis in order to understand customer behavior and what they are calling for and to to also understand how well the agents are handling the calls and whether the issues being called about is being resolved as this would go a long way improving the company's services and customer satisfaction is paramount to any business, with all these in mind the following questions was answered,

- Total number of calls answered and total calls abandoned
- Speed of answer(avg speed of answered and avg speed of answer among agents)
- Which topic is most called aboutÂ .
- Average Length of calls
- Total number of calls received monthly
- Agent's performance quadrant ->

## RECOMMENDATION

1. Call Handling Efficiency: Out of a total of 5000 calls, only 946 were left unanswered. this number is not soo bad but can be improvedÂ ,To maintain this efficiency, the reasons for unanswered calls should be found and strategies implemented to reduce further them.

2. Agent Performance SpotlightÂ : Jim and DanÂ , the top agents. Jim answered 536 calls with a satisfaction rate of 3.39, while Dan followed closely with 523 calls and a satisfaction rate of 3.45. Recognize and reward high performers, and consider knowledge sharing sessions to elevate the entire team. and also ensuring the workload is evenly distributed and no one has to carry a bigger work to ensure and maintain efficiency.
3. Striking a Balance with Talk Duration: The average talk duration stands at 3.25 minutes. this should be investigated to ensure that the conversations align with customer expectations and does not deviate from that.
4. Navigating Hot TopicsÂ : Streaming, technical support, and payment-related issues were the top three discussed topics with 1022, 1019, and 1007 calls, respectively. Invest in targeted agent training to increase expertise and resolution rates in these areas. also consider creating a much more detailed guide's on those topics and adding it to the help page to reduce the number of calls/enquires on them
5. Monthly Call spikeÂ : January saw the highest call volume with 1772 calls, compared to February and March with 1616 and 1612 calls, respectively. Analyze and pinpoint the reasons behind this spike and use the discovered insights to proactively manage future peak periods.
6. Customer SatisfactionÂ : Keeping a close watch on customer satisfaction metrics, especially for resolved calls. Identify areas for improvement through agent training or process enhancements to elevate satisfaction rates.
8. Establishing Continuous MonitoringÂ : Implement a regular monitoring system to track ongoing performance metrics. This is to enable swift responses to emerging trends or issues, providing a proactive approach to the call center management.
